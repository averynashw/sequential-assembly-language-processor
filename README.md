# Sequential Assembly Language Processor
### Digital Computer Architecture Implementation
Sequential processor capable of running assembly code, built in a circuit simulator application called Logisim. Performs matrix multiplication, sorting algorithms, and can execute nearly any arbitrary program written in assembly language.

See [final-report.pdf](final-report.pdf) for complete design specifications and implementation details with circuit diagrams.
